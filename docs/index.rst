Tower
======================================
For Spatially Aware Decision Making Algorithms
-----------------------------------------------


Intro
---------
Tower uses GDAL and Rasterio to interface with raw raster data in a variety of formats.
A built-in socket server makes it possible to host this information via UDP to client applications.
The intent of this project is to offer a framework for those wishing to implement decision making algorithms on top of geographic
information.
